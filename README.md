# My first social network create with React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This project still under development. It is not yet production-ready.
To check how does it looks and works you can follow by this link https://social-network-on-react.vercel.app/react-social-network/

# You can log in to this app with Login and password, which I can send to you via any messenger. Then you can check app from inside with user loaded from server. 
# Or you can use one of the hardcoded user's login and password, which you can find on the authorization page on the left side. But theese user will not have all functionality.
